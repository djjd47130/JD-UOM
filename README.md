# JD-UOM - Delphi Library to Convert Unit of Measure

### NOTE: This library is in active development, and is not ready for use at this time. 

### NOTE: Do not get confused with the term `unit` - it is used to reference a unit-of-measurement, and does not mean a "delphi unit". Except for in documentation, such as below.

## Features
- `TUOMUtils` - Class encapsulating all possible unit conversions.
- `TUOM` - Object representing a single possible unit of measure, registered into `TUOMUtils`.

## Units

- Unit [**JD.Uom.pas**](/Docs/JD.UOM.md) - Central access to all possible units of measurement and conversions.

**And much more to come...**
