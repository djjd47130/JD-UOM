# JD-UOM - Delphi Library to Convert Unit of Measure

### NOTE: This library is in active development, and is not ready for use at this time. 

### NOTE: Do not get confused with the term `unit` - it is used to reference a unit-of-measurement, and does not mean a "delphi unit". Except for in documentation, such as below.

## Features
- `TUOMUtils` - Class encapsulating all possible unit conversions.

## Units

- Unit [**JD.Uom.pas**](https://github.com/djjd47130/JD-UOM/blob/main/Docs/JD.UOMUtils.md) - Central access to all possible units of measurement and conversions.
  - **TUOMUtils** - Main class to access all possible unit conversions and information.
- Unit [**JD.Uom.Length.pas**](https://github.com/djjd47130/JD-UOM/blob/main/Docs/JD.UOM.Length.md) - Conversion between lengths.
- Unit [**JD.Uom.Area.pas**](https://github.com/djjd47130/JD-UOM/blob/main/Docs/JD.UOM.Area.md) - Conversion between areas.
- Unit [**JD.Uom.Volume.pas**](JD.Uom.Volume.pas) - Conversion between volumes.
- Unit [**JD.Uom.Temperature.pas**](JD.Uom.Temperature.pas) - Conversion between temperatures.

**And much more to come...**
