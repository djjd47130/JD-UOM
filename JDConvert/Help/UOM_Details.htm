 Summary</H1>
<P> 
 This mode provides detailed information about all 
registered UOMs along with a comparison chart.</P>
<P><IMG alt="" src="Images/JDConvertDetails.png"></P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<H1>Systems Filter</H1>
<P>This lists all possible UOM systems (Metric, Imperial, 
US Customary, etc.) with a checkbox next to each. Toggling these checkboxes will 
refresh the "Units" list to the right to only those UOMs which are part of the 
selected systems. Note that a single UOM may be a part of more than 1 system. For example, "Foot" is 
part of both the "Imperial" and "US Customary" systems.</P>
<P>        
             
           NOTE: Some systems have "(Huge)" 
and "(Tiny)" at the end of their name, corresponding with the scale of the UOMs within. For example, a "Femtometer" 
is "Metric (Tiny)" whereas a "Petameter" is "Metric (Huge)".</P>
<P>        
             
                
                    
        &nbsp;</P>
<H1>Category Filter</H1>
<P>This lists all possible UOM categories (Distance, Area, 
Volume, Mass, Temperature, etc.). Selecting an item will refresh the "Units" list to the right to 
only those UOMs which are part of the selected category. This 
will also reload the chart below to show a comparison of UOMs within that category.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<H1>Units List</H1>
<P>This lists all possible UOMs which are a part of the 
selected Systems and Category. Selecting an item will refresh the "Unit" details 
panel to the right.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<H1>Unit Details</H1>
<P>This displays details about the UOM selected in the 
"Units" list.</P>
<UL>
  <LI>
<DIV><STRONG>Name</STRONG> - The SINGULAR name of the 
  UOM, which is used as its main unique identifier.</DIV>
  <LI>
<DIV><STRONG>Name Plural</STRONG> - The PLURAL name of 
  the UOM, which is loosely used as a unique identifier.</DIV>
  <LI>
<DIV><STRONG>System(s)</STRONG> - The measurement 
  system(s) associated with the UOM (Metric, Imperial, US Customary, etc.), 
  separated by commas.</DIV>
  <LI>
<DIV><STRONG>Suffix</STRONG> - The suffix string which 
  gets displayed after a value of the given UOM, which is also a case-sensitive 
  unique identifier.</DIV>
  <LI>
<DIV><STRONG>From Base</STRONG> - The formula to convert 
  the UOM FROM the category's base unit.</DIV>
  <LI>
<DIV><STRONG>To Base</STRONG> - The formula to convert 
  the UOM TO the category's base unit.</DIV></LI></UL>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<H1>Comparison Chart</H1>
<P>This displays a visual comparison between all the UOMs 
matching the selected Systems and Category.</P>
<UL>
  <LI>
<DIV><STRONG>Negative Checkbox</STRONG>  - When enabled, chart will display 
  negative values to the left, where "0" will be in the center.</DIV>
  <LI>
<DIV><STRONG>Count</STRONG> - Use this control to change the number of 
  values to be displayed in the chart.</DIV>
  <UL>
    <LI>
<DIV><STRONG>NOTE</STRONG>: Be careful, as large values like 10,000 will 
    freeze the application while loading.</DIV></LI></UL>
  <LI>
<DIV><STRONG>UOM Checkboxes</STRONG>  - Toggle individual UOMs on or off to 
  show or hide them within the chart.</DIV>
  <UL>
    <LI>
<DIV>This is particularly helpful to hide larger UOMs 
    so you can see smaller ones more easily.</DIV></LI></UL></LI></UL>
