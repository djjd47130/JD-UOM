     Summary</H1>
<P>This application&nbsp;allows you to convert units of 
measurement, as well as see various details / statistics of those UOMs. Units 
are separated into "Categories", such as "Distance", "Area", "Volume", "Mass", 
"Temperature", etc. Each category has a "Base" UOM assigned to it, typically the Metric system. For example, the base of "Distance" is "Meter", and 
the base of "Mass" is "Gram".</P>

     System              
     UOMs</H1>
<P>              
     Upon installation of JD Convert, the installer allows 
you to choose which UOM categories you want installed (Distance, Area, 
Temperature, etc.). These are referred to as the "System" UOMs, or otherwise 
"built-in", and cannot be directly              
     modified.</P>

     &nbsp;</P>
<H1>              
     Custom              
     UOMs</H1>
<P>              
     JD Convert supports the ability to create and manage 
your own custom UOMs. You may create UOMs for an existing category (such as 
Distance), or your own entirely different category. Custom UOMs are available 
system-side along with the built-in              
     ones.</P>
<P>              
     See&nbsp;<A href="UOM_Builder.htm"><STRONG>UOM 
Builder</STRONG></A> for more              
     information.</P>

     UOM              
     Names</H1>
<P>              
     Each UOM has both a singular and plural name assigned to 
it. These act as unique identifiers for the UOM - duplicates are not              
     permitted.</P>
<UL>

<DIV>              
     Singular names are the MAIN unique identifier of the              
     UOM.</DIV>
  <LI>
<DIV>              
     Plural names are loosely treated as a secondary 
  unique identifier of the              
     UOM.</DIV></LI></UL>

     UOM              
     Suffixes</H1>
<P>              
     Each UOM has a suffix assigned to it. This is the text 
that gets inserted after a value of that UOM. For example, 123.45 Kilometers 
would be 123.45 km. These act as a case-sensitive unique identifier for the UOM 
- duplicates are not              
     permitted.</P>

     UOM              
     Categories</H1>
<P>              
     Each UOM has a category assigned to it. This is the 
overall grouping of UOMs which can be converted between each other. For example, 
Distance, Area, Volume, Mass, Temperature,              
     etc.</P>

     UOM              
     Systems</H1>
<P>              
     Each UOM has one or more systems assigned to it. These 
are a larger grouping of conversion systems, such as Metric, Imperial, US 
Customary,              
     etc.</P>
